# 3-26 ASM Programming - Application

[Back to README](README.md)

Complete the following tasks:

(Enter an 'x' when complete.)

1. `[ ]` Complete [lab](4_lab.asm).
2. `[ ]` Compile your program as `4_lab` using `nasm` and `gcc` or `ld`.
3. `[ ]` Run [application test](5_application_test.py) to test your program.

```
INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS:  
```


## 1. Complete Lab

In this lab, you will write and compile a program. The instructions for the 
lab are in `4_lab.asm`. Implement the program in assembly as directed.


## 2. Build Program

Compile your program using `nasm` to generate an object file. Then, assemble 
your program using `gcc` or `ld`. Directions on how to do this were covered in 
earlier modules (such as the Tools application or the Basic Debugging module).


## 3. Run Application Test

Test your application by running `5_application_test.py`.

``` sh
./5_application_test.py
```

or 

``` sh
python3 5_application_test.py
```

This will print out results of your solution test. Output of the test will tell
you if the test passed or not. If the test did not pass, fix any errors and try
again.

Note the output and fix any errors if needed. If you need help, ask an 
instructor. You can also debug your code using `gdb`.
